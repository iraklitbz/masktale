# ⭐⭐⭐ ABSOLUTE STYLE CONSISTENCY - CRITICAL ⭐⭐⭐

{STYLE_PROFILE}

THIS IS PART OF A MULTI-PAGE STORYBOOK. You MUST use EXACTLY the same artistic style, color palette, technique, and visual aesthetic as specified above. ALL pages must look like they belong to the same book, created by the same illustrator.

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
✓ Use the EXACT SAME brush stroke technique and texture
✓ Use the EXACT SAME color palette and tones - maintain color harmony
✓ Maintain the EXACT SAME level of background detail and simplification
✓ Apply the EXACT SAME lighting approach (direction, softness, intensity)
✓ Keep the EXACT SAME artistic aesthetic and "hand" of the illustrator
✓ Use the SAME line weight and outline treatment
✓ Apply the SAME level of shading and highlight technique
✓ Maintain the SAME composition style and framing approach

CONSISTENCY ANCHOR POINTS:
- Think of yourself as the SAME illustrator creating ALL pages
- Imagine this is a physical book where a parent would instantly notice style inconsistencies
- The color palette should feel like it comes from the same set of paints
- The brush technique should feel like the same hand painted all images
- The overall "feel" must be identical across all pages

If generating multiple pages: Before starting, mentally establish your artistic style based on the profile, then maintain it exactly for every page.
