## CONTEXT: PHOTOREALISTIC FACE-SWAP FOR CHILDREN'S STORYBOOK

You are creating a semi-realistic digital painting for a personalized children's book using MAXIMUM FACIAL REALISM. This is NOT a cartoon - the child's face MUST look photographic while the environment can be more illustrated. Think Pixar/Disney's most realistic character rendering.

## CRITICAL: FACIAL REALISM REQUIREMENTS

**PRIORITY #1 - PHOTOREALISTIC FACE INTEGRATION:**
The child's face from the reference photos MUST be integrated with PHOTOGRAPHIC ACCURACY:

1. **Skin Texture & Details** (CRITICAL):
   - Preserve ALL natural skin texture from the reference photos
   - Include subtle skin pores, natural skin variations, and real skin luminosity
   - NO smoothing, NO cartoon-style simplification
   - Night lighting shows skin texture differently but it's still real
   - Skin should look like a high-quality nighttime portrait photograph

2. **Facial Features Accuracy** (CRITICAL):
   - Exact eye shape, color, and iris details from photos
   - Eyes soft with gentle emotion (bittersweet goodbye)
   - Real eyelashes catching subtle magical light
   - Precise eyebrow shape, color, and natural texture
   - Accurate nose structure with soft highlights from magical light
   - Exact lip shape, color - gentle smile
   - Match hair texture, color, softly lit by stars and magic

3. **Lighting on Face** (CRITICAL - COMPLEX NIGHT LIGHTING):
   - PRIMARY: Magical portal light (warm purple-gold) from left side
   - SECONDARY: Cool starlight from above (soft blue-white)
   - TERTIARY: Firefly glow (warm yellow-green spots)
   - Light temperature: Mixed - warm magical + cool stellar
   - Natural skin appearance in magical lighting (still realistic)
   - Highlights: Soft, multi-colored from various light sources
   - Shadows: Deep blue-purple, soft edges, mysterious but gentle
   - Catch lights in eyes: Magical sparkle reflecting portal and stars
   - Subsurface scattering: Subtle glow on thin skin areas
   - Face must look REAL despite fantastical lighting

4. **Expression & Emotion**:
   - Emotion: Bittersweet - sad to say goodbye but happy for the friendship
   - Eyes: Gentle, warm, slight moisture suggesting emotional moment
   - Mouth: Soft smile, genuine but tinged with sadness
   - Overall: Mature emotion for a child - understanding that goodbyes happen
   - Face showing wisdom beyond years, touched by magic
   - Natural child expression of hopeful melancholy

## TASK: SEAMLESS FACE INTEGRATION IN MAGICAL NIGHT SCENE

**Source Materials:**
- Reference photos: {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION} - Use this as your facial blueprint
- Base illustration: Nighttime garden with magical portal
- Target expression: Bittersweet but hopeful goodbye

**Your Task:**
Replace the child's face in the base illustration with the PHOTOREALISTIC face from the reference photos. The face must look like a high-quality nighttime portrait while being illuminated by magical light sources, harmonizing with the illustrated fantasy environment.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Image Quality:**
- Resolution: High definition, nighttime photography quality
- Face detail: Maximum detail despite low-light scenario
- Light complexity: Handle multiple colored light sources realistically
- Integration quality: Perfect blending with complex lighting
- Dynamic range: Balance bright magical elements and dark night

**Integration Requirements:**
1. Handle multiple colored light sources on face naturally
2. Skin tone must adapt to magical lighting but stay realistic
3. Shadows from multiple sources must layer correctly
4. Face must be clearly visible and emotional despite night setting
5. Light from portal should wash left side warmly
6. Starlight should provide cool rim lighting
7. Firefly glows should create tiny realistic highlights
8. Expression must be clear and genuine in magical light
9. Face mustn't look flat despite diffused lighting (needs dimension)

**Challenging Aspects to Handle:**
- Multiple colored light sources (must blend naturally)
- Night scene (face still needs clear visibility)
- Emotional subtlety (bittersweet expression needs nuance)
- Magical elements (must enhance, not overpower face)
- Color temperature mixing (warm + cool light balance)
- Maintaining realism with fantastical elements
- Creating depth in night scene

**Avoid These Common Errors:**
- ❌ Cartoon-smooth skin (keep natural texture!)
- ❌ Oversaturated magical colors on face (balance warmth)
- ❌ Face too dark (needs to be visible and clear)
- ❌ Lost facial details in shadows (preserve features!)
- ❌ Unnatural color mixing (purple skin looks dead, not magical)
- ❌ Flat lighting (face needs dimension even with soft light)
- ❌ Overly bright fireflies (subtle, not spotlight-level)
- ❌ Portal light too harsh (should be diffused and magical)
- ❌ Expression unclear (emotion must be visible)
- ❌ Scene too busy (magic shouldn't overwhelm the goodbye moment)
- ❌ Unrealistic colored lighting (skin still looks like skin!)

## FINAL OUTPUT

Create a semi-realistic digital painting that looks like a **real child photographed at night with magical lighting** during an emotional goodbye scene. The child's face should be so realistic that you can see the genuine emotion - the gentle sadness mixed with hope and the memory of an amazing friendship.

The viewer should think: "This child really experienced something magical, and even though saying goodbye is hard, they'll treasure this friendship forever. I can see it all in their face."

This is the emotional heart of the story - make it beautiful, magical, and deeply touching while keeping the face photorealistic and authentic. The magic should serve the emotion, not distract from it.
