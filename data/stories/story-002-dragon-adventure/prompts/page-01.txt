## CONTEXT: PHOTOREALISTIC FACE-SWAP FOR CHILDREN'S STORYBOOK

You are creating a semi-realistic digital painting for a personalized children's book using MAXIMUM FACIAL REALISM. This is NOT a cartoon - the child's face MUST look photographic while the environment can be more illustrated. Think Pixar/Disney's most realistic character rendering (like "Coco" or "Encanto").

## CRITICAL: FACIAL REALISM REQUIREMENTS

**PRIORITY #1 - PHOTOREALISTIC FACE INTEGRATION:**
The child's face from the reference photos MUST be integrated with PHOTOGRAPHIC ACCURACY:

1. **Skin Texture & Details** (CRITICAL):
   - Preserve ALL natural skin texture from the reference photos
   - Include subtle skin pores, natural skin variations, and real skin luminosity
   - NO smoothing, NO cartoon-style simplification
   - Real skin has slight imperfections - keep them for authenticity
   - Skin should look like a high-quality portrait photograph

2. **Facial Features Accuracy** (CRITICAL):
   - Exact eye shape, color, and iris details from photos
   - Real eyelashes with natural thickness and length
   - Precise eyebrow shape, color, and hair texture
   - Accurate nose structure with natural highlights and shadows
   - Exact lip shape, color, and natural texture
   - Real ear shape if visible
   - Match hair texture, color, and the way it falls naturally

3. **Lighting on Face** (CRITICAL):
   - Natural, cinematic lighting as if photographed in real morning sunlight
   - Soft, warm light coming from upper-left (morning sun angle ~45°)
   - Natural skin subsurface scattering (light penetrating skin slightly)
   - Realistic highlights on cheeks, nose tip, forehead
   - Soft shadows under chin, nose - not harsh or cartoon-like
   - Catch lights in eyes should look natural and real
   - Light temperature: Warm (5500K) like natural morning sunlight

4. **Expression & Emotion**:
   - Emotion: Surprise and wonder (discovered something magical)
   - Eyes: Wide open, pupils slightly dilated, eyebrows raised naturally
   - Mouth: Slightly open in an "Oh!" expression of amazement
   - Overall: Authentic child expression of discovering something incredible
   - Facial muscles engaged naturally (not posed or stiff)

## TASK: SEAMLESS FACE INTEGRATION

**Source Materials:**
- Reference photos: {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION} - Use this as your facial blueprint
- Base illustration: Garden scene with baby dragon
- Target expression: Surprised wonder and delight

**Your Task:**
Replace the child's face in the base illustration with the PHOTOREALISTIC face from the reference photos. The face must look like a high-quality photograph while harmonizing with the semi-illustrated environment.

**Face Position:**
- Location: Left-center of image (x: 0.35, y: 0.4)
- Pose: Child is kneeling on grass, body slightly turned toward the dragon
- Head angle: Slight turn toward camera and dragon, natural child posture
- Face size: Prominent but proportional to 4-8 year old child body

## SCENE DETAILS

**Setting: Sunny Garden Morning**
- Time: Mid-morning (~10 AM)
- Weather: Clear, sunny, perfect spring day
- Location: Backyard garden with colorful flowers

**Environment Elements:**
- Foreground: Lush green grass where child is kneeling, some daisies and small flowers
- Mid-ground: Large, vibrant sunflowers (yellow-orange), purple lavender, red roses
- Background: Wooden garden fence (light brown), blue sky with few white clouds
- Special: Baby dragon peeking from behind sunflowers on the right side

**Baby Dragon Description:**
- Size: Small (like a large cat or small dog)
- Appearance: Cute and friendly, NOT scary
- Scales: Iridescent blue-purple, shimmering in sunlight
- Wings: Small, translucent with membrane visible
- Eyes: Large, curious, friendly green eyes
- Posture: Peeking out shyly but curiously from flowers

**Child Posture & Clothing:**
- Position: Kneeling on grass with hands slightly forward
- Clothing: Casual summer clothes (bright colored t-shirt, shorts) - keep it simple
- Body language: Leaning slightly toward dragon, showing interest but not fear
- Hands: One hand slightly extended as if about to reach out gently

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS - SEMI-REALISTIC HYBRID

**CRITICAL STYLE BALANCE:**
- Child's FACE: 95% photorealistic (as real as a portrait photo)
- Child's BODY: 80% realistic with slight illustration stylization
- Dragon: 60% illustrated fantasy creature with realistic textures
- Environment: 50% painterly/illustrated with realistic lighting

**Visual Reference Style:**
Modern Pixar/Disney hybrid realism:
- "Coco" (2017) - level of facial realism on human characters
- "Encanto" (2021) - realistic skin tones and facial features
- DreamWorks "How to Train Your Dragon" - environmental blending

**Technique Specifications:**
- Rendering: Semi-realistic digital painting
- Brush style: Mix of photographic detail (face) and painterly strokes (background)
- Texture: High detail on face, medium detail on body, stylized on environment
- Edge quality: Soft, natural edges (not sharp vector-style)

**Color Palette:**
- Overall tone: Warm, inviting, magical but natural
- Dominant colors: Greens (grass, leaves), blues (sky, dragon), yellows (sunflowers)
- Accent colors: Purple (lavender, dragon scales), reds (roses)
- Skin tones: Natural, warm caucasian/asian/latino (match {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION})
- Light quality: Warm golden sunlight, not oversaturated

**Lighting Details:**
- Primary light: Natural sunlight from upper-left at 45° angle
- Light quality: Soft but directional (not harsh noon sun)
- Fill light: Ambient sky light, subtle and cool-toned
- Atmosphere: Light rays visible through flowers (volumetric light subtle)
- Shadows: Soft-edged, natural density, warm-toned from grass reflection
- Overall: Feels like real outdoor photography but in illustrated world

**Atmosphere & Mood:**
- Feeling: Magical discovery, wonder, safe and exciting
- Air quality: Clear, crisp morning air with slight haze for depth
- Depth of field: Slight focus on child's face and dragon, background softly blurred
- Magic elements: Subtle sparkles around dragon, nothing too flashy

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Image Quality:**
- Resolution: High definition, print-ready quality
- Face detail: Maximum detail preservation from reference photos
- Integration quality: NO visible seams, perfect blending at face edges
- Color accuracy: Natural, true-to-life skin tones

**Integration Requirements:**
1. Match lighting direction between face and scene perfectly
2. Blend neck/face transition seamlessly (check jawline, ears, hairline)
3. Ensure hair from photos integrates naturally with scene
4. Face shadows must match scene's lighting logic
5. Face size must be proportional to body and scene scale
6. Expression must feel genuine, not artificially pasted

**Avoid These Common Errors:**
- ❌ Cartoon-smooth skin (keep natural texture!)
- ❌ Overly saturated skin colors (keep natural tones)
- ❌ Artificial-looking eyes (use real eye details from photos)
- ❌ Flat lighting on face (needs dimension and depth)
- ❌ Mismatched lighting direction (face vs scene)
- ❌ Visible seams at face edges (blend perfectly!)
- ❌ Expression looks pasted on (must be authentic)
- ❌ Face too large or too small for body
- ❌ Unnatural neck position or color
- ❌ Lost facial details from reference photos

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, verify:
✓ Face looks like a real photograph (could fool someone)
✓ Skin texture is natural with visible pores and variations
✓ All facial features match reference photos exactly
✓ Expression is authentic and age-appropriate for surprise/wonder
✓ Lighting on face matches scene lighting direction and quality
✓ No visible seams or integration artifacts
✓ Face size proportional to body
✓ Hair blends naturally into scene
✓ Neck and shoulders transition seamlessly
✓ Overall scene feels cohesive (photo-real child in illustrated-real world)
✓ Dragon looks friendly and magical
✓ Garden setting is inviting and colorful
✓ Composition guides eye to child's face and dragon
✓ Mood is magical, wonder-filled, and safe

## FINAL OUTPUT

Create a semi-realistic digital painting that looks like a **real child photographed in a painted storybook world**. The child's face should be so realistic that it could be mistaken for a photograph, while the dragon and garden have that magical illustrated quality that makes this clearly a fantasy storybook.

The viewer should think: "That child looks exactly like the real kid in the photos, and they're in this beautiful, magical illustrated world!"
