      "technique": "Classic comic book illustration with bold ink lines and marker coloring. Hand-drawn feel with confident brush strokes. Clean line art style reminiscent of European bande dessinée and classic American comics.",
      "colorPalette": "Limited, muted color palette. Soft watercolor or marker tones - not fully saturated. Earth tones, warm oranges, soft blues. Colors stay within the lines. Slight paper texture visible.",
      "lineWork": "BOLD BLACK INK OUTLINES on everything. Thick confident lines defining silhouettes. Varying line weight - thicker for outlines, thinner for details. Brush pen or marker style strokes. Every shape has a clear black border.",
      "texture": "Hand-drawn ink texture. Visible brush strokes in the lines. Slight crosshatching for shadows. Paper grain texture. Marker color bleeding slightly at edges for organic feel.",
      "lighting": "Simple directional lighting suggested through line weight and minimal shading. Shadows rendered with crosshatching or solid black areas. Not photorealistic - stylized comic lighting.",
      "detailLevel": "Medium detail - focus on expressive faces and clear silhouettes rather than photorealism. Simplified backgrounds with key elements. Characters are the focus.",
      "atmosphere": "Warm, approachable comic book feel. Like a story you'd read in a classic comic strip or European graphic novel. Inviting and friendly, not intimidating.",
      "artisticReferences": "Tintin/Hergé ligne claire, Darwyn Cooke retro style, classic newspaper comic strips, European BD (bande dessinée), brush pen manga influence. Bold outlines, flat colors, expressive characters."
